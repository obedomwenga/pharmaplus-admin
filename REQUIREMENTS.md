## Functional Requirements

### Dashboard
- Display summary of key metrics (sales, orders, etc.)
- Quick access to all major sections

### Promotions Management
- Create, view, edit, and delete promotional offers
- Configure different types of promotions (product-specific or bundle)
- Set discount types (percentage or fixed amount)
- Define promotion validity period
- Set usage limits (per user and total)
- Upload promotional materials (images/PDFs)
- Activate/deactivate promotions

### Products Management (Future Implementation)
- Product listing with search and filter
- Product creation and editing
- Inventory management
- Product categorization

### Orders Management (Future Implementation)
- Order listing with search and filter
- Order status updates
- Order details view
- Order processing workflow

### User Management (Future Implementation)
- User listing with search and filter
- User profile management
- Role and permission management

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Fast page load times (<2s)
- Optimized API calls with caching where appropriate
- Responsive UI with no lag during interactions

### Security
- Input validation for all forms
- Data sanitization for API requests
- Secure authentication and authorization (to be implemented)

### Usability
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Intuitive navigation with clear information hierarchy
- Consistent UI elements and patterns
- Helpful error messages and validation feedback

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA attributes where necessary
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast that meets WCAG guidelines

## UI Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- Primary Brand Colors:
  - Green: `#16a34a` (with light `#22c55e` and dark `#15803d` variants)
  - Blue: `#0ea5e9`
- Neutral Colors:
  - Gray variations for backgrounds and text
- State Colors:
  - Success: `#16a34a`
  - Error: `#dc2626`
  - Warning: `#f59e0b`
  - Info: `#0ea5e9`

### Typography

- `/api/products` - CRUD operations for products (future)
- `/api/orders` - CRUD operations for orders (future)
- `/api/users` - CRUD operations for users (future)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all components and functions
- Proper type definitions for all props and state
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)
- Component organization following the single responsibility principle

### Testing Strategy (Future Implementation)
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for pages
- E2E tests for critical user flows

### Performance Considerations
- Code splitting for large components
- Image optimization
- Lazy loading of off-screen content
- Memoization of expensive calculations

## Deployment (Future Implementation)
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Automated testing before deployment
- Staging environment for QA
- Production deployment with rollback capability

## Future Enhancements
- Authentication and user management
- Analytics dashboard
- Reporting features
- Integration with other systems (inventory, point of sale, etc.)
- Mobile app version
